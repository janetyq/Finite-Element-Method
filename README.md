## Equations
### L2 Projection
Given a function $f(x, y)$, we can find its best approximation in the finite element space, which is the space of linear functions on the triangular mesh.

### Poisson's Equation
Poisson's equation is a partial differential equation that can be used to model heat transfer, electrostatics, fluid flow, and other phenomena. It is defined as $\Delta u = f$, where $f$ is a given function and $u$ is the unknown function we are trying to solve for. 

Using the finite element method, we can solve for $u$ by finding the weak form of the equation and discretizing it into a linear system.

This example shows the velocity potential $u$ (where gradient of velocity potential = flow velocity) of fluid flow around an obstacle. The Robin boundary conditions are: $u = 0$ on the obstacle, and $n \cdot \Delta u = \frac{du}{dx} = 3$ on left inlet and $n \cdot \Delta u = -\frac{du}{dx} = -1$ on the right outlet. 

### Wave Equation
The wave equation is a partial differential equation that describes waves as they propogate through space and time. It is defined as $\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \Delta u$, where $c$ is the wave speed and $u$ is the scalar function describing the wave.

We can simulate the wave propogation over time with Crank-Nicolson integration, solving for $u$ at each timestep.

    <img src="images/wave_demo2.png" alt="wave_demo2" width="45%" />
</div>

The wave starts as a single pulse and propogates outwards at a constant speed. When it collides with the boundary, it reflects back and interferes with itself, creating a standing wave pattern.

### Heat Equation
The heat equation is a partial differential equation that describes the distribution of heat over time. It is defined as $\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \alpha \Delta u$, where $\alpha$ is the thermal diffusivity and $u$ is the temperature.

We can simulate the heat distribution over time with Backwards Euler integration, solving for $u$ at each timestep.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between;">

    <img src="images/heat_demo2.png" alt="heat_demo2" width="45%" />
</div>

In this example, there is an initial high temperature bump in the corner of the domain. The heat diffuses outwards and eventually will reach a steady state where the temperature is constant. Heat is conserved in this simulation, where the mean temperature of the domain is constant over time.


### Linear Elastic Mechanics
The linear elastic mechanics solver can solve for the displacement and stress field of a solid object given applied forces and boundary conditions. 

![linear_elastic_demo1](images/elastics_demo1.png)

The starting mesh is a supported cantilever beam. We fix the left edge and apply a downward force on the right most edge, and a uniform body force due to gravity.

![linear_elastic_demo2](images/elastics_demo2.png)

The resulting deformed mesh shows the beam bending under the forces with a max stress at the corner of the support. 

Note: This example shows extreme displacement, in reality, the object would no longer be in the linear elastic regime and the solver would not be accurate.

## Adaptive Refinement

The solver can also perform adaptive mesh refinement to increase the accuracy of the solution. It works by calculating the a posteriori error estimate of each element and refining the elements with the largest error. We maintain the triangle quality of the mesh with regular (red-green) refinement.

Here, we show adaptive refinement on solving Poisson's equation.

![adaptive_refinement1](images/poissons_adaptive_refinement1.png)

We can see that the residual error is concentrated near the center of the domain, so the solver refines the mesh in that area. The final mesh has a much higher resolution in the center and much lower residual error.

## Topology Optimization

Topology optimization is a method of structural design where the material distribution of a structure is optimized to minimize some objective function. In this case, we are minimizing the compliance of the structure, which is the amount of deformation under a given load.

The boundary conditions are that the left edge is fixed and a downward force is applied to the right edge. The material distribution is represented by a density field, where 0 is no material and 1 is full material. The solver uses the SIMP (Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization) method to penalize intermediate densities.

![topopt_demo](images/topopt_demo.png)

The solver starts with a uniform density field and iteratively updates the density field to minimize the compliance. This image shows the final density field. This structure reduces maximum displacement by over 70% compared to the uniform density structure.
